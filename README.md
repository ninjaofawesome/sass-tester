# SASS-TESTER: A Test project to try package installation

## What is this?

A quick project to see if I can create a plug and play scss library ([tester-pkg](https://github.com/ninjaofawesome/tester-pkg)) and use it in another project.

## How does this work?

If you take a quick peek into App.scss, you will see that I've imported all the scss files from tester-pkg at the top of the document.  Thus, all of those styles are available for use throughout a project.

You may check App.css for the end result of the css, as well as seeing the proof of concept with a simple `npm start`.  Note that I added class "c" to one of the elements.
